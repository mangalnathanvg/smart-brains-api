# SmartBrains - A Facial Recognition Full Stack Application
SmartBrains is a capstone project for the Udemy Course - Zero to Mastery: Full Stack Web Development by Andrei Neagoie. 

The entire application comprises of two subsystems:

1) smart-brains-api - Backend server developed by using the express framework. The server handles and services requests made by the front-end of the application to provide resources.

2) smartbrains - Front end developed using ReactJS, JSX and ES6 to develop user interface and handle interactions with the web server.
